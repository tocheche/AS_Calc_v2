NOTES
 From VFF_LBFG_v2 one needs files: fort.111, fort.124, fort.201, and fort.601 or fort.6abc (e.g., fort.6010, fort.6120, ...);
    fort.6abc collects atoms coordinates of intermediate configurations obtained during the minimization procedure.
 Formula for calculus eps: Pryor, J. Appl. Phys. 83, 2548 (1998).
 Formula for calculus eps: Gullet, Modelling Simul. Mater. Sci. Eng. 16 (2008) 015001.
 nxp is a cutting number (< nx=ny) which sets the xy cross-section radius(=nxp*a1) for various z coords.
 radcut is close (larger) as value of d12 (Ga-Sb bond length) and d13 (Ga-As bond length), in Angstrom unit. 
    if radcut is large enough (11 e.g.) eps (strain field) is calculated for all atoms.
    radcut is used if met=1 (Pryor); its value doesn't affect the calculus for met=2 (Gallet). 
if ff=0d0 the damping (introduced for z>0) of the diagonal tensor elementsepsxx, epsyy, epszz used to acoomodate the 
    bulk behavior (value=0) is canceled.
index is an integer smaller than 5; it is the index for adf(:);
    index=1,2,3,4,5 starts the damping at z=nzmax*a2*(0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9). adf is introduced if desired
    to accomodate faster (reduce the calculus time) the diagonal strain tensor components
    epsxx, epsyy, epszz to the bulk value (i.e., 0) in the capping domain.
In fort.124, QD=1 for hemi-torus;  QD=2 for cone;  QD=21 for truncated cone; QD=3 for pyramid; QD=3 for core-shell
msfit is parameter used to fit the misfit, distance between atoms which is considered as a misfit.
    e,g.: PA-NA bound length is a misfit if dpn(q)<dc12*(1-msfit) or dpn(q)>dc12*(1+msfit) - in Misfit_v2.f90.
