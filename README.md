# AS_Calc_v2
AS_Calc_v2 is created to handle easier the data generated by AS_LBFG_v2 and calculate the strain for each atomic location from the initial configuration. 
The strain field is calculated with data provided by AS_LBFG_v2 by using the files fort.111, fort.124, fort.201, temp280, temp240, temp260, and fort.601 or fort.6ab0 (e.g., fort.6010, fort.6120, ...). The files for the atomic positions generated by AS_LBFG_v2 are as follows: fort.38, fort.39, fort.140, fort.160, fort.180, fort.201.
